title: Setting up PI Hole
---

<p>
I've finally gotten around to setting up Pi-hole on my home network. I
had previously played around with it a few years ago on a Raspberry PI
3 but eventually just stopped using it. This time around I know a bit
more about Docker and decided to run the containerized version
alongside the other services that I have running on my desktop like
Jellyfin.
</p>

<p>
  Pi-hole describes itself as a "DNS sinkhole that protects your
  devices from unwanted content without installing any client-side
  software.<sup><a href="https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole">1</a></sup>"
  It comes installed with a good default block list and allows for
  easy viewing of queries made by everything on the home network.
</p>


<h2>Configuration issues</h2>
<p>
  I ran into only one real problem getting the docker-compose.yml
  working. Using the default configuration
  from <a href="https://github.com/pi-hole/docker-pi-hole/#running-pi-hole-docker">the
  docs</a>, I was getting this error when running <code>docker-compose
  up</code>:
<pre>
  <code>
    ERROR: for pihole Cannot start service pihole: driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint pihole (1bec1a8867742465aff279b75a80090f7f63fccaf07e2dd171fc44659895cb3f):
    Error starting userland proxy: listen tcp4 0.0.0.0:53: bind:
    address already in use ERROR: Encountered errors while bringing up the project.
  </code>
  </pre>
</p>

<p>
  I found a useful discussion on an issue similar to
  mine <a href="https://github.com/sameersbn/docker-bind/issues/65">here</a>. The
  solution was to explicitly specify the localhost address along with
  the ports listed. My final working docker compose file can be found
  below:
</p>

<pre>
  <code>
version: "3"

# More info at https://github.com/pi-hole/docker-pi-hole/ and https://docs.pi-hole.net/
services:
  pihole:
    container_name: pihole
    image: pihole/pihole:latest
    ports:
      - "192.168.1.2:53:53/tcp"
      - "192.168.1.2:53:53/udp"
      - "192.168.1.2:80:80/tcp"
    environment:
      TZ: 'America/LosAngeles'
    volumes:
      - './etc-pihole:/etc/pihole'
      - './etc-dnsmasq.d:/etc/dnsmasq.d'
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN # Required if you are using Pi-hole as your DHCP server, else not needed
    restart: unless-stopped
  </code>
</pre>

<h2>Router Tweaks</h2>
<p>
  Next I had to change a router setting to point to my desktop as the
  DNS server for anyone one the network. I set the primary DNS server
  to be the local address of my desktop and the secondary as 1.1.1.1.
  If I really wanted to be sure that everything was being using Pi
  Hole as the DNS server I wouldn't have any need for the secondary
  address, but there are times where I'd like to have my desktop off,
  so it's nice that there is a fallback.

<h2>Finished setup</h2>
<p>
Once the router settings were applied everything on the network
started talking with Pi Hole and I was able to access the web admin
portal pretty easily.
