<p>
  Earlier this year I did an internal inteview at the comapny I work
  at, AVEVA, talking about my role at the company and why I enjoy
  working here. It's finally public and part of our recruting page! I
  wanted to share it here because I'm proud of putting myself out
  there and doing something that was a little outside of my confort
  zone.
