    I've been wanting a home server for a while now. Both as a way to try out new technology and as a practical way to
    aggregate my digital life into one place. In the past I've done some experimenting with standing up self-hosted
    services on Linode, but I don't need these services everywhere I go and I wanted more storage space than I was
    willing to pay for in the cloud. For the most part, I'm only on my computer while at home so standing up services on
    the LAN is a simpler solution than relying on cloud hosting.

    So recently I bit the bullet and purchased two 4TB Seagate Iron Wolf NAS drives and put them in my desktop. I had
    previously only used this computer to play games and host a small Minecraft server for my friends. Since it was
    going to be primarily a server from now on, I nuked my install of Windows and replaced it with Ubuntu 22.04. While
    I've gotten familiar with Windows in the past year due to work, Linux is still where I'm most comfortable when it
    comes to anything server related.
</p>

<p>
    Other than familiarity there is one major advantage that got me set on using Ubuntu for this desktop overhaul: the
    ZFS filesystem. Compared to the NTFS filesystem of Windows, ZFS has desirable features that I want when managing a
    server long term. Notably, ensuring data integrity through several different forms of software RAID is something
    NTFS just can't offer. Any kind of data corruption that is found on disk can be corrected with information stored on
    the other disks with a ZFS pool. Microsoft has been developing a filesystem similar to ZFS called ReFS, but that is
    only available on the server OS versions.
</p>

<p>
    To set up ZFS I put my two new drives in a mirrored pool so that I could take advantage of ZFS' error correction and
    detection. While this cuts my usable storage space in half, from 8TB to 4TB, I'd rather have the increased
    reliability that ZFS offers over the extra storage space. I'm not anywhere near needing the full 8TB (let alone the
    4TB of usable space) so using the data integrity features that ZFS offers seems like a no brainer.

    I set up Nextcloud as the primary way of syncing files between computers (both my files and Ellie's). I could have
    just used samba and avoided the more involved process of setting up a LAMP stack, but I wanted something user
    friendly for Ellie, who is used to the Dropbox/OneDrive style of file management. You also get a lot of extra
    goodies on top of just file syncing. The most interesting to me are the photo organization and sharing application
    as well as the calendar app.
</p>

<p>
    Another reason I chose a Linux distribution for this overhaul of the desktop was to be able to continue playing the
    video games I enjoy. Otherwise, I might have tried FreeBSD, where ZFS is a native file system, instead of Ubuntu.
    Valve has made huge investments in the Linux ecosystem and it shows. I was able to play my entire steam library
    seamlessly. I also got Lutris installed to make playing games outside of Steam fairly painless. Right now, I'm
    playing Guild Wars 2 through Lutris with great performance.
</p>

<p>
    This is not to say that everything is as easy as it was on Windows in the gaming realm of things. There was an issue
    with the July 19th update to GW2 where the game launcher would crash unexpectedly. I eventually resolved this by
    trying out different wine runtimes. The fshack (full screen hack) variants along with turning shader caching off
    seems to fix everything for me.
</p>

<p>
    There are still some things that I need to figure out to be totally comfortable maintaining this system long term.
    First, I need a good backup script. I have the following datasets so far: nextcloud, mariadb, and games. I only
    really care about backing up nextcloud and mariadb since the games can just be re-downloaded if something bad were
    to happen. I've already worked out how to use ZFS send to copy snapshots to an external drive. However, I don't know
    enough about backing up SQL databases safely to know I am not corrupting anything on my backup snapshots. This is
    the one thing I want to figure out sooner rather than later.
