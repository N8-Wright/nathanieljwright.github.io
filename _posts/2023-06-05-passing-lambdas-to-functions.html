title: Passing lambdas to functions in C++
---

<p>
I ran into an interesting problem the other day when I was trying to write my
own thread pool in some C++ code that I was working on. The thread pool
accepts work and stores it internally in a queue of std::function&lt;void()&gt;.
This allows any kind of simple function signature to be passed into the
thread pool and executed once a thread becomes available. The ergonomic
way to use this is by submitting a lambda function like:
</p>

{% highlight cpp %}
threadPool.Queue([] { std::cout << "Printing from a worker thread." << std::endl); });
{% endhighlight %}


<p>
This works fine for a lot of different lambdas that I tried, but falls apart
when that lambda contains a capture of a move-only type. I had created a
lambda that captured a HttpListenerResponse class which contains a TcpSocket
that is written to with the web serverâ€™s response. TcpSocket is a move-only
type since it is the sole owner of a socket handle which it closes upon
running its destructor. This makes the resulting lambda a move-only type
and causes all sorts of errors to be spewed out by the compiler when it
attempts to shove it into a std::function. 
</p>

{% highlight cpp %}
auto context = listener.Receive();
auto lambda = [response = std::move(context.Response)]
{
	const auto resp = HttpResponse(
		HttpStatusCode::Ok,
		std::unordered_map<std::string, std::string>
		{
			{"Server", "Neat Server (Win32)"},
			{ "ContentType", "text/html" },
		},
		"<html>Hello world!</html>");

	const auto formattedResp = resp.Format();
	response.Write(formattedResp);
};

threadPool.Queue(lambda);
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
I will spare you the pagefuls of errors printed and just show the three relevant lines.
</p>

{% highlight shell %}
..\webserver.cpp(43): note: 'main::<lambda_1>::<lambda_1>(const main::<lambda_1> &)': function was implicitly deleted because a data member invokes a deleted or inaccessible function 'Neat::Net::Http::Listener::HttpListenerResponse::HttpListenerResponse(const Neat::Net::Http::Listener::HttpListenerResponse &)'
..\net\http\listener\http_listener_response.h(13): note: 'Neat::Net::Http::Listener::HttpListenerResponse::HttpListenerResponse(const Neat::Net::Http::Listener::HttpListenerResponse &)': function was implicitly deleted because a data member invokes a deleted or inaccessible function 'Neat::Net::Socket::TCPSocket::TCPSocket(const Neat::Net::Socket::TCPSocket &)'
..\net\socketstcp_socket.h(17): note: 'Neat::Net::Socket::TCPSocket::TCPSocket(const Neat::Net::Socket::TCPSocket &)': function was explicitly deleted
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
Once I understood that the issue was a deleted copy method I was pointed to a
great <a href="https://youtu.be/3jCOwajNch0?t=3037">CppCon video</a> that
covers this exact problem. The solution (for now) is to wrap the move-only
lambda inside a shared pointer which CAN be copied around. There other solution suggest
in the talk was a move-only function type. One could write their own, or wait for C++23
where <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/functional/move_only_function">std::move_only_function</a>
will be a thing. I may try to write my own move-only function in the future just for
educational purposes.
</p>

{% highlight cpp %}
threadPool.Queue([p = std::make_shared<decltype(lambda)>(std::move(lambda))]() { (*p)(); });
{% endhighlight %}
