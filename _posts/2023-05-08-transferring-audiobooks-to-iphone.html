title: Transferring Audiobooks to iPhone
---

<p>
  Doing things the Apple way has never really clicked with me. This is
  not a new complaint. It has been this way with Apple products
  forever. However, it still bothers me. Especially when I'm hopping
  around from Windows to Linux to whatever else I want to try
  out. Syncing music, audiobooks and other files from my computer on
  to my phone is my one consistent pain point. I just want to plug in
  my phone, drag and drop my files onto it, and then move on with my
  life. But Apple, in all their wisdom, thinks that having to use
  iTunes or the built in MacOS file manager that obfuscates
  everything. On Linux, I've had middling success in being able to
  plug my phone in and have it be recognized as anything remotely
  useful.

  One consistently decent way of just getting a file onto the iPhone
  has been spinning up a local web server that serves all the files in
  a directory to anyone on the LAN. I can then navigate to {My
  computer's local IP}:8080 and tap on the files to download them. I
  can quickly spin up this local server by running something
  like <code>ruby -run -e httpd .</code>. Substitute whichever
  program/language you prefer or have available to you.

  For audiobooks, transferring files this way sacrifices the ability
  to play them in the default Books app. However, BookPlayer has been
  a good alternative for me and is able to access files that end up in
  the Files from this roundabout transfer method.
