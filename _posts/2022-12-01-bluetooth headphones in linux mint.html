    I've had a really bad time in the past connecting my Sony headphones to my laptop running Linux Mint. Specifically,
    it's the Sony WH-XB910N, although I'm fairly sure I'd have issues pairing with any other headphones. Previously,
    I've either not been able to pair them at all, or when paired successfully there would be issues. The headphones
    would work, but I wouldn't be able to use the microphone.

    It turns out (at least for the pairing issue), the fix to get it working was simple once I started messing around
    with the network settings.

    I toggled PAN Support and DUN Support to Blueman (the default Bluetooth manager in Linux Mint) from it's original
    setting of NetworkManager. Magically, this got my headset to pair correctly! I don't know which setting actually is
    needed (or if both are), but I haven't experienced any negative consequences from these changes so ðŸ¤·
