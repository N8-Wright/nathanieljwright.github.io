title: Learning about alternate data streams in NTFS
---

<p>
There are many interesting things about the NTFS filesystem that I never knew existed
(or, at least, haven't been relevant to me in the past).
Currently, I've been learning about
<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/file-streams">alternate data streams</a>
and the various ways that
they can be used to store extra information <i>inline</i> alongside a file.
</p>

<p>
Normally, I'd try to store information about a 
file by creating an extra hidden file or folder where that information could 
be stored separately. Say, for example, that you want to store a hash of a 
file. The result of this approach would be your file <b>test.txt</b> and a hash 
stored somewhere like <b>./.hidden/test.hash.txt</b>. This works, but adds 
overhead to managing files since you'd need to move <b>test.txt</b> and it's 
accompanying hidden metadata files around in tandem if you don't want to
lose the hash data.
</p>

<p>
Using alternate data strems, this hash can be stored <i>inline</i> with the
file in question. Instead of storing the hash in a separate file, you could
store it by writing to <b>test.txt:hash</b>. The colon separator followed
by the name of the stream is how alternate data streams can be accessed on
any file for reading and writing. Both powershell and the Win32 library give
good access to these capabilities.
</p>

<h2>Getting a file's alternate data streams</h2>

<h3>Powershell</h3>
<code>
Get-Item ./test.txt -Stream *
</code>

<h3>Win32</h3>
<p>
This code is taken from a project I've been working on, <a href= "https://github.com/N8-Wright/CommanderData">CommanderData</a>.
Feel free to ignore this sample code if you want. The main idea is at least somewhat obfosucated by the use of boost coroutines. The 
gist of things is to use the <a href= "https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-findf  irststreamw"> 
FindFirstStream</a> and <a href= "https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-findn  extstreamw">FindNextStream
</a> functions to iterate through a file's streams.
</p>

<code>
<pre>
using boost::coroutine2;
coroutine<WIN32_FIND_STREAM_DATA>::pull_type IterateStreams(const WCHAR* file)
{
	return coroutine<WIN32_FIND_STREAM_DATA>::pull_type(
		[file](coroutine<WIN32_FIND_STREAM_DATA>::push_type& sink)
		{
			WIN32_FIND_STREAM_DATA findData{};
			auto findHandle = FindFirstStreamW(file, FindStreamInfoStandard, &findData, 0);
			if (findHandle == INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE)
			{
				BOOST_THROW_EXCEPTION(FilesystemException("Unable to iterate file streams") << FileNameInfo(file));
			}
			do
			{
				sink(findData);
			} while (FindNextStreamW(findHandle, &findData) != 0);

			FindClose(findHandle);
			const auto lastError = GetLastError();
			if (lastError != ERROR_HANDLE_EOF)
			{
				BOOST_THROW_EXCEPTION(FilesystemException("Unable to finish iterating file streams") << FileNameInfo(file));
			}
		}
	);
}
</pre>
</code>

<h2>Reading/writing an alternate data stream</h2>
<p>
Reading and writing singular alternate data streams is incredibly simple. It's built in
to the normal Win32 file functions. All you need to do is pass the "test.txt:<stream name>" 
in as the file name instead of just "test.txt". For example, with
<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-createfilew">CreateFile</a>:
</p>

<code>
<pre>
const auto readHandle = CreateFileW(
	L"test.txt:hash",
	GENERIC_READ,
	FILE_SHARE_READ,
	nullptr,
	OPEN_EXISTING,
	FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL,
	nullptr);

const auto writeHandle = CreateFileW(
	L"test.txt:hash",
	GENERIC_WRITE,
	0,
	nullptr,
	CREATE_ALWAYS,
	FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL,
	nullptr);
</pre>
</code>

<p>
By using alternate data streams, you can avoid having to store separate information
about a file in a different location. This makes moving files around much easier since
you don't have to worry about any external data being lost or not relevant anymore. It
also avoids any issues about clogging up a folder with generated metadata and just
feels cleaner overall.
