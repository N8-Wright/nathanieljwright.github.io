title: Accessing Webcams Remotely
---

<p>
  Ellie and I are on a quick weekend trip to attend a wedding in Bear
  Valley. Weâ€™re leaving behind our two cats in what is supposed to be
  quite a hot weekend: highs of 98 and 97 degrees on Saturday and
  Sunday. Weâ€™ve left the cats on their own over the weekend
  before. They have automatic feeders and enough water to last twice
  that amount of time. And this time around, weâ€™ve even left the AC on so
  that they are nice and comfortable despite the heat.
</p>

<p>
  Even knowing they would be fine; I took the opportunity to
  experiment with accessing my desktopâ€™s webcam remotely so that we
  could check up on them whenever we are away. We left town with the
  jankiest home security setup imaginableâ€¦ two webcams taped to a box
  pointing in different directions in the middle of the hallway. Both
  cameras arenâ€™t hooked up to any special software (although I did
  take a look at trying to set up motion or Shinobi, but they are
  meant for something a bit more serious than usb cameras). They are
  accessible over ssh where I can pipe some ffmpeg output into a video
  player on my laptop.
</p>

<p>
  Here is the script that I've mostly taken from a nice
  <a href=https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/2302/can-i-pipe-dev-video-over-ssh>stackexchange
  post</a>. By using tailscale, I'm able to easily ssh into my desktop
  at home with the ip address they provide.
</p>

{% highlight shell %}
  ssh user@ip ffmpeg -an -f video4linux2 -s 640x480 -i /dev/video2 -r 10 -b:v 500k -f matroska - | mplayer - -idle
{% endhighlight %}

  And here is what it looks like accessing the webcam from my laptop:

  Test" />
</p>

<p>
  It's been fun to see what the cats have been up to while we are
  gone! And it's a bit more peace of mind that they haven't gotten up
  to anything too crazy ðŸ˜º.
