title: Emacs GPG Issues
---

<p>
  I've been playing around with an Emacs setup on Manjaro for the past
  day or two. Everything was going well until I tried to introduce my
  gpg commit signing workflow that I've been trying to adhere to in my
  personal projects. I set git's global config to always request a gpg
  signature, but then whenever I'd go to commit anything in any
  project I'd receive an error saying that gpg was using an
  "inappropriate ioctl for device". This occurred when I was invoking
  git commit from the command line or from emacs. To fix this, I
  eventually found that I had to change some defaults in the gpg
  config as well as the pinentry settings in Emacs.

<h1>GPG Command Line Fix</h1>
<p>
  I found the fix for the ioctl
  issues <a href="https://d.sb/2016/11/gpg-inappropriate-ioctl-for-device-errors">here</a>. I
  needed to create two files, gpg.conf and gpg-agent.conf and add the
  following configuration entries to them.
</p>

<h2>gpg.conf</h2>
<code>
  <pre>
    use-agent
    pinentry-mode loopback
  </pre>
</code>

<h2>gpg-agent.conf</h2>
<code>
  <pre>
    allow-loopback-pinentry
  </pre>
</code>

<h1>Emacs pinentry configuration</h1>
For Emacs, I wanted to be able to input my gpg password into the minibuffer. This is accomplished by adding this line to init.el.

<code>
  <pre>
    (setq epa-pinentry-mode 'loopback)
  </pre>
</code>
