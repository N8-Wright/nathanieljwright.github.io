title: Projectile Indexing Doesn't Respect .gitignore
---

<p>
  Projectile is an amazing project management utility for Emacs. I've
  been using it primarily for git repositories. It works great
  combined with fuzzy finding in the command buffer to find files and
  navigate a project structure quickly. Here is an example of what I
  am talking about.

<p>
  There has been one annoying thing about using Projectile on Windows
  though. By default, the .gitignore file is ignored when finding
  files within a project. This means that the selections given are
  polluted with tons of files that I would never want to open.

<p>
  This is because on Windows, the default indexing method for project
  files is set to native. This means that file indexing is done
  natively in lisp and only respects the contents of a .projectile
  file. I'd rather not create another configuration file in each
  project I'm working on. Especially since this would just be a
  repetition of the contents of what I already have in
  .gitignore. Additionaly, it's a non-standard configuration file that
  is meaningless for any other editor or anyone else that views my
  code in other editors.
</p>

<p>
  Fortunately, the indexing method can be easily set to an
  alternative. The defaults for other operating systems (linux, mac,
  etc.) is alien, which is what we want as well. Alien indexing relies
  on an external command (git and find, for example) to do the
  filtering. These commands understand the concept of .gitignore and
  won't pass any files along to projectile that they are configured to
  ignore. Since git and mysys binaries are usually installed on my
  Windows machines, I feel comfortable relying on this behavior. Here
  is how you can modify the default behavior.
</p>

<code>
  <pre>
    (use-package projectile
      :config
      (projectile-mode +1)
      :custom
      (projectile-indexing-method 'alien))
  </pre>
</code>

<p>
  This fixes the only major annoyance I've had with projectile! The
  only noticeable difference between the two indexing modes (other
  than one returning the expected results and the other not) is that
  alien indexing produces a longer lag in receiving results than
  native. I can only guess that this is because projectile needs to
  spawn a git and/or find process to produce the results instead of
  just recursively listing files in a project directory.
