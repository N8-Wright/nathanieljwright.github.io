    I've been using the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/single-file/">SingleFile</a> addon in
    Firefox a lot recently to save a local copy of the webpages that I visit.
</p>

<p>
    Previously, I had been saving copies of webpages using the print to PDF feature in my browser. This was all well and
    good for most websites that I wanted to preserve, but sometimes formatting would be severely messed up, leaving the
    contents of the page unreadable. Even worse, sites with a lot of images or other large content would bloat the
    generated
    PDF to somewhat astounding sizes. It was not uncommon for PDFs of pages that were not just simple text to be
    anywhere
    from five to twenty megabytes in size.

<p>
    Using SingleFile, I've been able to preserve the web pages I visit in their correct formatting and not have to deal
    with
    this weird PDF bloating problem that I've often encountered. This is because it just saves the page as a .html file
    that
    contains all the text, media, etc. that is on the page. While it's not always the case that the .html generated is
    smaller than the equivalent PDF, I've not experienced a point where the size gets egregious. All this while
    preserving
    the original formatting.
