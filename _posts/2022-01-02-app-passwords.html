    I've been in the process of trying to move my email usage over to Thunderbird. I like the idea of using an
    open-source application for something that handles relatively sensitive information. I've also just become more and
    more frustrated by the lack of capabilities of the default Windows Mail app. So, I started the process of installing
    Thunderbird and moving my email accounts over to it.
</p>
<p>
    One of the immediate hurdles when trying to sign into my main email account, njwright456@outlook.com, is that I
    don't have a password set up to login to it. For the past year or so I've been using the Authenticator app as well
    as a YubiKey to sign into my account, no password required. This poses a bit of a problem for Thunderbird, whose
    support for this interesting setup is less than ideal. To be fair, Thunderbird offers the option of doing a 2FA sign
    in, but it only seems to work with non-personal Outlook accounts. The only other option is to default back to a
    password sign in.
</p>
<p>
    Microsoft (and I believe Google) offers a solution to this particular problem in the form of App Passwords. You can
    find this option in the Settings -> Security page of your Microsoft account settings.

<p>When you “Create a new app password” you’re presented with this page. You get this one chance to copy the password
    and use it in whatever application needs it.</p>

<p>
    So, for Thunderbird, you have to generate one of these app passwords and use it to login. I've only had to do this
    once. Thunderbird remembers the password you've given it and I haven't had to go through this rigamarole again. It
    seems to me like this just circumvents the whole point of using a password-less Microsoft account, but at least it
    works for my needs. The passwords generated seem relatively strong as well. I don't know how this is enforced, but
    the passwords generated here can only be used in applications like email clients, etc. that need a password to sign
    in. You're not able to use the passwords generated here to actually sign into your account through any normal means.

    Here's hoping at some point I can just use my YubiKey or 2FA to sign into my account in Thunderbird.
