title: Reaching level 50 in Elder Scrolls Online
---

<p class=MsoNormal>After about half a year of casually playing Elder Scrolls
    Online and creating many different character/class combos, I've finally reached
    level fifty on the class that I care about using as my main: a high elf
    sorcerer. Despite reaching the max level, there is still so much that I want to
    do and I feel like I’ve barely scratched the surface of this game’s lore and
    group content.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On the lore and story side of things, I’ve only finished the
    starting zone, <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Online:Khenarthi's_Roost">Khenarthi’s
        Roost</a>, and the first zone, <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Online:Auridon">Auridon</a>.
    I’m in the process of completing the quests in <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Online:Grahtwood">Grahtwood</a> and
    hit level
    fifty as I was following along with the story of Queen Ayrenn’s ratification
    ceremony and doing the random daily dungeons each time I logged in. These are
    just the zones I’ve completed on my high elf. I’ve experienced all the other
    starting zones as well as Vvardenfell on the plethora of characters I’ve
    created but later became disenchanted with playing. There is still so much
    story content to get through. I haven’t even finished the main game, but I know
    that there are many expansions that seem to be brimming with extra things for
    me to explore.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On the group content side of things, I’m somewhat interested
    in doing Trials. From what I understand (I still feel very new to the end game
    stuff), Trials are ESO’s version of raids. The first step for me there is
    figuring out what kind of gear I need to be working towards. I’ve looked a
    little bit at meta builds for Sorcerers online and while the gear
    recommendations fly over my head right now, I did notice that a lot of the
    builds recommend skills that I don’t have access to yet. They are either Mages
    Guild or Psijic Order specific skills. I’ve already joined the Mages Guild, but
    it is incredibly slow to level. The Psijic Order seems to be an expansion skill
    line. Unless I want to skip around in the game’s story content, I don’t know if
    it makes sense for me to go grab this skill line without experiencing the story
    that leads up to it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If anyone wants to show me the ropes or is just interested
    in hanging out on the Xbox, my gamertag is <a href="https://xboxgamertag.com/search/N82129">N82129</a>.</p>
