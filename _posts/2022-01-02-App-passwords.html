    I've been in the process of trying to move my email usage over to Thunderbird. I like the idea of using an
    open-source application for something that handles relatively sensitive information. I've also just become more and
    more frustrated by the lack of capabilities of the default Windows Mail app. So, I started the process of installing
    Thunderbird and moving my email accounts over to it.

    One of the immediate hurdles when trying to sign into my main email account, njwright456@outlook.com, is that I
    don't have a password set up to login to it. For the past year or so I've been using the Authenticator app as well
    as a YubiKey to sign into my account, no password required. This poses a bit of a problem for Thunderbird, whose
    support for this interesting setup is less than ideal. To be fair, Thunderbird offers the option of doing a 2FA sign
    in, but it only seems to work with non-personal Outlook accounts. The only other option is to default back to a
    password sign in.

    Microsoft (and I believe Google) offers a solution to this particular problem in the form of App Passwords. You can
    find this option in the Settings -> Security page of your Microsoft account settings.

<p>When you “Create a new app password” you’re presented with this page. You get this one chance to copy the password and use it in whatever application needs it.</p>
