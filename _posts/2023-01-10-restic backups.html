    I've been getting a lot more comfortable managing my local ZFS filesystem over the past year. I've gotten to a point
    where I'm confident in my ability to troubleshoot any basic issues that I could encounter. Although, fortunately,
    they have been few and far between. I've ditched Nextcloud and replaced it with just a simple samba configuration.
    For my personal needs, this has been an acceptable change and there's a lot less server management/setup that I have
    to keep in mind. This change makes my local backups easier as well, since I no longer run services that use a SQL
    database and don't have to deal with correctly backing those up.

    It's only this year that I've started to dip my toes into backing up my data to the cloud. Since I have a Office365
    subscription, I wanted to take advantage of the 1TB of storage that I get in OneDrive instead of spending more money
    on a separate backup endpoint. At least, I don't want to at the momentâ€¦ So I needed to choose something that works
    with backing up to OneDrive.
</p>

<p>
    I ended up choosing <a href="https://restic.net/">Restic</a> since it can operate with rclone. <a
        href="https://github.com/rclone/rclone">Rclone</a> is the actual
    thing that connects to OneDrive
    and Restic, the backup tool, can be configured to use it to write and read the files that it needs to. I followed
    <a href="https://itsfoss.com/use-onedrive-linux-rclone/">this guide</a> on how to set up rclone with OneDrive, but
    you can configure it to talk to <a href="https://github.com/rclone/rclone#storage-providers">a whole bunch of
        different
        services</a> as well.
</p>

<p>
    Currently I don't do anything fancy to keep the backups up to date. I have a script with the directories I care
    about listed out that I just run manually. I'll be experimenting more with this system in the future, but for now
    I'm just happy that all of my important (and some less important) data is backed up locally as well as remotely.
