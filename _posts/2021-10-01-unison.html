    I've been in the process of figuring out an easy back up and sharing solution for all my files. I have several
    computers that I'd like to share files between. For me, that means being able to access an up-to-date “Documents”
    and “Projects” folder. Other stuff that could get quite large, like photo and video, are included in this setup
    currently, but could be broken out into a different process if they become unwieldy to have on every single device.

    What I've had for a while now, and have been manually managing, is a desktop computer running windows and sharing a
    network drive with SMB over the local network. There are a few annoyances with doing this on a Windows 11 Home
    system. One REALLY annoying thing is that you can't login over the network with your main user account since that is
    a Microsoft account and not a local one. You also can't just turn off user validation and allow anyone on the
    network into the drive…for reasons that I still don't quite understand. What I ended up having to do is create and
    grant access to a “Nathan Network” local user that I could login in with. I assume I wouldn't run into the same
    problems on a server edition of the OS, but I'm not paying for that. I've experimenting with this setup on Linux
    over Samba and had a much nicer experience, but then I couldn't multipurpose the home server for my precious video
    games.

    What I've added though is a cool little program called Unison. It's basically a rsync type of program that can
    synchronize files in both directions. So, if I make an edit on my laptop that can be synced with the server. If I
    make an edit on the server that can be synced back with the laptop as well. This bidirectional sharing happens with
    just the Unison program running from the laptop and scanning for changes server-side and client-side. So now,
    instead of manually copying files back and forth that I've changed, I can have something a little bit closer to
    Dropbox/OneDrive, albeit, still, a more manual one.

    The UI isn't the prettiest, but usable. And you can always run through the command line if that's your jam.
