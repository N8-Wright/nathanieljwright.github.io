    A week or two ago I installed Lineage OS on Ellie's OnePlus
    6T. The phone had been giving her problems for the better part of
    a year (as far as I can tellâ€¦could have been much longer). Apps
    would open slowly and would randomly crash. Battery life was
    dismal and it was a bad idea to leave home without a charger. So,
    I took it upon myself to try to fix the issues with the phone by
    installing a custom Android ROM called Lineage OS. As far as I
    understand, it's a version of Android that stays as close to stock
    as possible (it doesn't even include the Google Apps or Play Store
    by default). Did this fix the problems plaguing the OnePlus 6T?
    Wellâ€¦somewhat. Some issues were resolved, new ones were
    introduced.  Overall, this wasn't the silver bullet I was
    originally hoping for ðŸ™„.

<h2>The installation process</h2>
<p>
    After backing up all the documents and photos to Ellie's google
    drive, I set out to blow away the default Android install and
    replace it with Lineage. I'd read the documentation twice before
    starting (like it was recommended) but immediately ran into issues
    trying to unlock the bootloader. With some extra help and
    manhandling the drivers into submission via Window's Device Manger
    just to get the phone connected over USB I was able to follow the
    installation instructions without a hitch.

<h2>SIM not detected</h2> 
<p>
  Once Lineage OS was installed, I was presented with a new problem:
  the SIM card wasn't detected! After some extensive googling and a
  lot of trial and error (some of which got the phone into a weird
  boot loop) I was able to fix all the issues and everybody lived
  happily ever after! Wellâ€¦. no. Actually, I gave up and went to
  bed. But the next morning I gave it another go, despite my
  frustrations.

  It turns out that you can't rely on just the
  bootloader and whatever firmware/drivers that Lineage OS brings by
  default. I ended up using this nifty tool to extract the firmware
  from the original OnePlus android iso and flashed each binary file
  to the phone while it was in recovery mode. After yet another
  re-install of Lineage, the SIM was detected!

<h2>Issues With Lineage OS</h2>
<p>
  With that grueling process over and done with we now have a working
  phone again. Most of the things Ellie does with on a day-to-day
  basis is supported. However, we had to go through the process of
  setting certain apps again that I didn't think about before wiping
  it (Duo was the most annoying). Some apps just didn't seem to be
  supported either. We couldn't find Park Mobile on the play store
  anymore and couldn't find a way to install it. While the battery
  life of the phone is a bit better, I don't think installing Lineage
  resolved any of the major issues Ellie had with the phone. Apps
  still crash (mostly the google apps ðŸ˜’). The phone seems less
  sluggish, but the benefits there are replaced with the frustration
  of having to learn the different user interface of Lineage than what
  Ellie was used to. In the end, I think we're getting a new phone for
  Ellie pretty soon. And I probably won't try to mess with her tech
  anymore, even though I did so with good intentions.
